Navy Motion Picture Movie Catalog

General:
Imports a list of movies as CSV and performs lookup on movie title
Exports a CSV file with Movie title and additional metadata such as imdb rating, actors, plot synopsis etc.

TODO:
1. Clean up and implement proper parameter sets and functionality.
2. Implement new Powershell Excel module to provide a more powerful import/export functionality with formatting, tables etc, and without need to convert csv text file to xls for use.
